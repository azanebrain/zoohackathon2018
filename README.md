# Conscious Consumer Chrome Browser Extension

Conscious Consumer is an open source Chrome Browser extension that educates users about sensitive key-terms that relate to conservation issues, and serves as an indicator of product sustainability. 

It helps users by searching ingredients in ecommerce site products.  The extension automatically searches site text and will target and notify the user if any keywords associated with a problematic ingredient is discovered.   

Conscious Consumer has an initial focus on problematic ingredients in food, body, and beauty products.  Once a problematic ingredient is found, the user is notified with a small pop up that contains information on why the ingredient is antagonistic for conservation efforts.
